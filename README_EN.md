# KRKTransit - live vehicle tracking and delay statistics for public transport in Kraków

Platform providing real-time public transport delay statistics (MPK, Mobilis) in Kraków. It is based on data provided by ZTP Kraków, published according to the GTFS specification (Static & Realtime).

Enables identification of route segments generating the highest delays, monitoring of long-term delay trends for each line and live vehicle tracking.

The code can be run locally, allowing you to independently build your own historical database of delays.

## API Endpoints

To avoid skewing results with unrealistic delays, statistics exclude the first and last stop of each trip.

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/lines/{line}/stats/max-delay` | Top 10 delay increments between consecutive stops |
| `GET /v1/lines/{line}/stats/route-delay` | Top 10 delays generated across the entire route |
| `GET /v1/lines/{line}/stats/punctuality` | Punctuality statistics by delay thresholds |
| `GET /v1/lines/{line}/stats/trend` | Daily average delay trend |
| `GET /v1/vehicles/positions` | Live GPS positions of all active vehicles |
| `GET /v1/shapes/{shape_id}` | Route geometry (ordered GPS points) |
| `GET /v1/trips/{trip_id}/stops` | Stops on a given trip |
| `GET /health` | Health check |

## Architecture

The system consists of five services, each handling a specific stage of the data flow. The services are decoupled, they don't import each other directly and maintain a strict separation of concerns. I would describe the backend, specifically the main flow of fetching, processing and storing data, as an `event-driven data pipeline`.

The project deliberately relies on a shared database architecture, as I believe a full microservices approach would only introduce unnecessary overhead at this scale. To keep things organized, the database is divided into three separate schemas: `gtfs_static`, `events` and `weather`.

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| **Importer** | Downloads and loads GTFS Static data (routes, stops, schedules, route shapes) for both operators. Detects file changes via SHA-256 hashing. |
| **RT Poller** | Fetches `VehiclePositions.pb` and `TripUpdates.pb` feeds. Publishes parsed vehicle positions to Redis Pub/Sub and caches trip update predictions. |
| **Stop Writer** | Listens for vehicle positions from Redis Pub/Sub. Detects stop events using three methods (see below). Writes events to the database. |
| **API** | Serves delay statistics, punctuality data, daily trends, live vehicle positions and route geometry. Caches statistics responses in Redis. |
| **Weather Collector** | Fetches historical weather data from Open-Meteo and stores it in the database. |

## Stop Event Detection

| Method | Trigger | Time Source |
|---|---|---|
| `STOPPED_AT` | Vehicle reports `STOPPED_AT` status | GPS timestamp |
| `SEQ_JUMP` | Stop sequence jump (skipped stops) | TripUpdates prediction cache |
| `TIMEOUT` | Vehicle started a new trip (completing the previous one) | TripUpdates prediction cache for the previous trip |

Estimated events (`SEQ_JUMP`, `TIMEOUT`) are available optionally via the `?include_estimated=true` parameter. By default, the API returns only events detected via `STOPPED_AT`.

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/grzechuzz/KRK_TRANSIT.git
 cd KRK_TRANSIT
```

2. Create the required files:
```bash
./scripts/local.sh bootstrap
```
   
3. Start the containers:
```bash
./scripts/local.sh up
```

4. Open the API documentation:
 ```bash

 ```

## Tests & Linting

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"

pytest                  # unit tests
ruff check .            # linting
ruff format --check .   # formatting
mypy .                  # type checking
```

CI runs everything on every push to main.
